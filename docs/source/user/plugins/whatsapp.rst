WhatsApp
--------

.. note::
   Slidge uses WhatsApp's `Linked Devices <https://faq.whatsapp.com/378279804439436/>`_ feature,
   which may require perioding re-linking against the official client. However, you can still not
   use or even uninstall the official client between re-linking.

Roster
******

Contact JIDs are of the form ``+<phone-number>@slidge-whatsapp.example.com``, where
``<phone-number>`` is the contact's phone number in international format (e.g. ``+442087599036``.
Contacts will be added to the roster as they engage with your account, and may not all appear at
once as they exist in the official client.

Presences
*********

Your contacts' presence will appear as either "online" when the contact is currently using the
WhatsApp client, or "away" otherwise; their last interaction time will also be noted if you've
chosen to share this in the privacy settings of the official client.
