Slidge uses :xep:`0114` (Jabber Component Protocol) to communicate with
an XMPP server.
Every slidge plugin runs in an independent process and requires its own
entries in the XMPP server config.
To keep this guide generic, we'll talk about running the slidge plugin
``superduper`` that connects to the fictional legacy network "Super Duper Chat Network".
