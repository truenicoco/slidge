Slidge is a general purpose XMPP (puppeteer) gateway framework in python.
It's a work in progress, but it should make
[writing gateways to other chat networks](https://slidge.im/core/dev/tutorial.html)
(*legacy modules*) as frictionless as possible.
It supports fancy IM features, such as
[(emoji) reactions](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0444.html),
[replies](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0461.html), and
[retractions](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0424.html).
The full list of supported XEPs in on [xmpp.org](https://xmpp.org/software/slidge/).

Slidge is meant for gateway developers, if you are an XMPP server admin and
want to install gateways on your server, you are looking for one of these projects:

About privacy
-------------

Slidge (and most if not all XMPP gateway that I know of) will break
end-to-end encryption, or more precisely one of the 'ends' become the
gateway itself. If privacy is a major concern for you, my advice would
be to:

-   use XMPP + OMEMO
-   self-host your gateways
-   have your gateways hosted by someone you know AFK and trust
